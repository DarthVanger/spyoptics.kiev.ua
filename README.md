This project is a simple, minimalistic e-shop, based on CodeIgniter php framework.

Libraries and tools used in the project
---------------------------------------

CodeIgniter (http://ellislab.com/codeigniter): php framework implementing MVC pattern, providing libraries for Mysql use, etc.

FlexSlider (http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/): javascript image slider.

jquery-mousewheel (https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel): jquery plugin that adds mousewheel support. It is used to catch mousewheel actions and animate vertical page sliding instead of usual scrolling.

HammerJS (http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/): javascript library for touches. It is planned to be used for vertical page sliding on mobile devices (just like it's made with mousewheel on PCs).
