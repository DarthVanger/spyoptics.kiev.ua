This is just the code of a simple, minimalistic e-shop, based on CodeIgniter php framework, http://spyoptics.kiev.ua.   
So, nothing interesting here!

Installing
----------
There's no easy installation, but if you want to try using this code (not recommended :), you can find the file with database structure at application/config/dbInstallScript.sql.

Config
------
Installing or moving to another host you should change following config files:

1.  application/config/constants.php

    Change "URL" constant to the URL where the site is located.
    
2.  assets/js/config/constants.js

    Change "BASE_URL" constant to the URL where the site is located.
    
3.  application/config/database.php
 
    Change user, db name, pass, etc. for mysql.
